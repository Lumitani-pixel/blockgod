## BlockFighter

An experimental combat and AI mod for Minecraft built with Fabric

### Overview
BlockFighter is an experimental combat automation mod designed to explore how well a Minecraft bot can fight — and how far you can push the mechanics of PvP through code.
Built with Fabric, it allows players and developers to create, customize, and optimize an in-game fighting bot capable of engaging in PvP battles against other players or entities.
The project aims to combine technical development and gameplay experimentation, giving both modders and players the ability to tweak combat styles, add new techniques, and test different AI behaviors.

### Goal
- The goal is to build a system where players can:
- Customize their bot’s fighting style via an intuitive GUI
- Implement or improve internal classes for optimization and performance
- Experiment with different combat strategies and behaviors
- Analyze PvP interactions through real-time rendering and feedback
In short: How strong, smart, and efficient can you make your bot?

### Planned & Current Features
- Customizable Combat AI — Create or tune your bot’s fighting logic
- GUI-based configuration — Adjust behavior and style in-game
- Combat Techniques — Sword, combo, axe, mace, and crystal fighting
- In-game Rendering Tools — ESP, PvP info overlays, hit indicators, etc.
- Extensible Codebase — Add your own fighting methods or internal optimizations
Future updates will continue refining AI behavior, visuals, and integration between gameplay and development tools.

### Development Goals
BlockFighter serves two main communities:
**Developers** — Experiment with Fabric, AI logic, rendering, and optimization
**Players** — Test and challenge custom bots in PvP environments
It’s designed to be open, flexible, and a great playground for anyone interested in Minecraft combat, AI, or modding technology.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Lumitani-pixel/blockfighter.git`
